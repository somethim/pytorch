# Project Learning Path

This repository outlines a learning path for machine learning, starting from beginner projects and progressing to more
advanced ones. The projects are designed to help you build foundational skills and gradually move towards expert-level
concepts.

## Learning Path

### Beginner Projects:

- [ ] **Binary Classification**: Predict if an email is spam or not spam.
- [ ] **MNIST Digit Recognition**: A classic starter project for digit classification.
- [ ] **Simple Price Prediction**: Predict house prices or stock prices based on historical data.

### Intermediate Projects:

- [ ] **Image Classification with CNN**: Classify images (e.g., cats vs dogs) using Convolutional Neural Networks (
  CNNs).
- [ ] **Sentiment Analysis with LSTM**: Perform sentiment analysis on text using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
- [ ] **Time Series Forecasting**: Predict future values from historical time series data.
- [ ] **Basic Autoencoder for Image Compression**: Implement a basic autoencoder to compress images.

### Advanced Projects:

- [ ] **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**: Build a GAN to create fake images that resemble real ones.
- [ ] **Transformer Model for Language Translation**: Implement a Transformer-based model for language translation
  tasks.
- [ ] **Style Transfer Network**: Transfer the artistic style of one image onto another using deep learning.
- [ ] **Object Detection System**: Build a system for detecting and classifying objects in images.

### Expert Level:

- [ ] **Multi-modal Learning**: Combine text and image data for joint learning tasks.
- [ ] **Few-shot Learning Systems**: Build models that can learn from very few labeled examples.
- [ ] **Custom Architecture Research Projects**: Design and implement custom architectures for specific tasks or
  datasets.

## Optional:

- [ ] **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Explore reinforcement learning as an optional advanced topic, diving into
  environments where models learn by interacting with them.

Happy learning and coding!
